# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application will suggest a random dish based on a selection from the user.  There are four categories to choose from: Side, Main Dish, Dessert, and Entire Meal.  The app will select a random dish from a group of provided dishes and suggest one to the user.  If "Entire Meal" is selected, the app will suggest a meal including one dish from each of the 3 other categories.

### Installation Instructions:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The goals of this project were:
1. Writing HTML and CSS to match a provided comp  
2. Get experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together
3. Understanding how to respond to user input
4. Individualizing my own programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1. Learning how to use CSS was a lot of trial and error. Figuring out how Flexbox works was a challenge but with enough googling and playing around I learned a lot.
2.  HTML continues to be a little confusing.  The syntax is very different than JavaScript and not intuitive to me.  The more I work with it the more comfortable I become though.
